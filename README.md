--------------------------------------------------
**Overview**

This repository contains a YOLO model trained on a dataset of basketball images. 

The model is aplied to a video to detect the position of a basketball and hoop.

With those positions the shot_detector.py file determines whether a shot attempt has been made. 

-------------------------------------------------
You can use this model on a video of yourself shooting around by replaing the path of "shootaround.mov" with the path of your own video.
